# ReservationApp
Application built as part of recruitment task, for internship program. It took me about 15 hours to complete the game, 5 of which I spent learning Angular.

## Technology used
- Angular
- Typescript
- Angular Material

## Problems i had
I found this project quit challenging, because of my lack of expiring in Angular ecosystem. I had to learn many new concepts such as: services, RxJS, controlFlow and many more. RxJS was especially problematic and to be honest I still find it hard to use. But apart from technological problems, I made a few mistakes with design of whole application. Shouldn't I have used the Calendar from Angular MAterial's library to display reservations. I also feel that i should have used more services(e.g. to store selected date in reservationList). However, even though I failed to complete the project, I have learn a lot about Angular Ecosystem and I have gained new motivation to work.
